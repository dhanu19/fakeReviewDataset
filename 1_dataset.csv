This is the first pair I ever bought many many years ago. I'm wearing them right now. I've tried the S9's, S10's, Jabra Halo, Jabra Sport, Arctic Cooling. That doesn't even include the plain old jerk-buds.These look atrocious. My wife hates them. They are still my gold standard.I have a walk that kills BT reception every time on every headset. These only lose the signal for half a step. The Jabra Sport, by contrast, doesn't even work when it is set on the table in front of me. The Arctic Cooling headphones are my latest. They are more comfortable, but still lose the signal whenever I walk outside.Yes, I live next to a Cell Tower. So my situation is very stressful for a BT headphone or headset.

The speaker audio is loud and clear and the microphone pick up crisp. I have had hands free on my previous car phones and it is the &quot;way to go&quot;. The kit is very inclusive and easy to install if you are comfortable with basic electronics and able to take the molding, etc, off your car in order to run the antenna coax, etc. (External antenna is not included but you really need to get one for maximum performance) Anyone who has installed a Ham or CB radio will be right at home. The mounting of the holder for the StarTAC cell phone itself may need some modification or you may want to make a bracket in order to get a neat installation.I would suggest that you mount it as high as possible in order to keep it as close to your driving line of sight for safety concerns. Mine worked flawlessly after a 2-3 hour install in a Ford F-150. Will be mounting one in our Lincoln TC soon. Also suggest that you mount the hands free microphone near the center of the car (near the rear view mirror or center it on the dash) so that a passenger can be heard should they speak.

99,B000JUV21W,Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset (Pumpkin Orange) [Motorola Retail Packaging],AEJAGHLC675A7,"John Williamson ""JargonTalk""",5,"Bluetooth cell phone headsets are really a subjective choice. Some love them and others hate them, and some models seem to fit one person's ear (and lifestyle) better than another.That being said, this reviewer will try to offer an (overdue) opinion on what has turned out to be a pretty good choice in a well-made Bluetooth cell phone headset.When I first looked at the Motorola H500, it's price tag was in the $100 range, so it was easy to pass on in favor of wired headsets. But with the recent price drops, this unit is not only worth considering, it's now even lower priced than some of the better wired units that were former favorites. Considering that so many states and localities have laws against cell phone use while driving, this can be an excellent communication tool if used carefully and safely.There are many brands and model out there to choose from, but the Motorola H500 is well worth consideration, especially in light of its excellent pricing. Once adjusted and positioned correctly to the ear, its overall sound quality has turned out to be excellent. Had held off on making a decision between brands and models mostly because I wear glasses, but after a bit of retail store test driving for fit and sound, found (like other reviewers) that this headset seems to settle easily to my ear and just seems to fit properly.One way of looking at how well a Bluetooth cell phone headset functions would perhaps be to rate its use during everyday tasks or activities, so here are a few of those, along with my personal findings.- Driving: excellent, quite functional, 5-stars.- Walking: excellent, 5-stars.- Cycling: excellent, low wind noise, 5-stars.- Running: OK, 4-stars (felt like it might fall off).- Computing: excellent, 5-stars.- Sleeping: decent, 4-stars... hey, just joking here!Don't want to go on a rant about driving while using a cell phone, but if you take the time to read your phone's manual along with the one for the Motorola H500, you'll find that you can use it with voice activated functions, so that you don't need to fool with cell phone dialing when driving. Just program your phone, say your party's name into the Bluetooth device and you'll be automatically connected.Color selections - something for everyone:-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Silver-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Black-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Pink-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Orange-Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset - Teal BluePros:- Overall good sound quality, very little static.- Comfortable to wear/use, has an ergonomic ear hook.- Clean, streamlined design.- Good range, better than some others.- Bluetooth 1.2 means less interference & faster connections.- Inexpensive, reasonably priced.- About 8 hours talk time and 200 hours standby time on a charge.Cons:- Ringtone alerts, but that's a personal thing.- Small volume controls.Is this Motorola headset the newest, latest and greatest? Nope. If you want that, check out the newJawbone II Bluetooth Headsetby Aliph, but then check out the price on that unit and compare the features.Summary:The Motorola H500 is an inexpensive Bluetooth cell phone headsets, offering good sound quality, nice ergonomics, and better-than-average range. It's an excellent communication device, adding to driving safety if used carefully. If you're looking for a good Bluetooth headset at a reasonable price, it's well worth considering.Update:For those who privately asked, my H500 didn't come in a box. It came in a ziplock-style bag that was marked ""bulk"" on the label. It contained the H500 headset, AC charger, user guides and a ""Motomanual."" From all appearances it was brand new.",05-09-2008 00:00,185.89.244.0/22,1220572800,0,0,FN,0.31111111111111106

My friends never really complain about the noise or sound while I am using it. I will say that it is annoying since you don't know if it is ""on"" or ""off"". When you try to call sometimes it will automatically dial the last number your cell phone has and it might not be the person you want to call. It also has a tendency to easily be turned on and I have more then one occassion called my brother a few times with it in my purse. That is just with it accidently having the button on the earpiece pushed and as I said before, it will automatically dial the last number it has on the cellphone. It does not ""sit"" inside the ear, but hangs from your ear. I have not had too much problems with that, but if you like to have the thing in the ear then this isn't the one for you.

There is also an slot in the back to charge a separate battery at the same time. The clock on the front is battery powered like a standard wristwatch and does not use the power from the cable, not sure what the reasoning is on this, maybe they meant for it to be something that was intended to be more portable.I did have one other charger for this same phone that was a cheaper generic version.

No more bulges in my pocket!- The build quality is great and it feels very solid and unlikely to break easily.- The dark gray color is very sleak and it has a nice metallic un-plasticy feel to it.- It has a impressive list of features - Bluetooth, Java games, a camera with quality higher than the standard VGA etc. to name a few.- It uses a standard mini-USB cable to charge which means that buying charger and/or data transfer cables is easy.Here are the bad points:- Very limited battery life. Usually I got somewhere in between 2 and 3 days (and I don't talk a lot!). I ended up buying a replacement battery from a 3rd party with a higher capacity. Now I get 5-6 days which is more reasonable.- A very annoying low battery warning. When this phone is anywhere near running out of battery it beeps loudly or vibrates for a long time (depending on the settings). It is not possible to turn this off, unless you silence the ring. In my opinion this makes it unusable when it is low on battery, and I always turn it off at that point. Why can't there be an option to change the low battery warning ring style independently of the regular ring, or even to turn it off altogether?- Verizon have changed the user interface to fit in with their brand. Menus have been rearranged and renamed. For example, if you want to download new wallpaper you have to go to the ""GET IT NOW"" menu and select ""Get PIX & FLIX"". Also, from reading reports elsewhere on the web I've heard that the user interface is not as usable than Motorola's default. Also I've heard that the default interface does not suffer from the slight delay that this has when navigating around the options screens.- Verizon have REALLY locked this phone down. You can't transfer data to or from this phone directly. For example, if you want to transfer a photo to your PC you can't use Bluetooth or a cable. The only way to do it is to E-mail it, and therefore pay Verizon. The same thing applies to wallpapers, ringtones and games. If you want them, you'll have to use Verizon's premium service, and pay them for it. Also, you can't manage the contacts using PC software because again Verizon have locked it down. This is VERY annoying. I believe that Verizon is the ONLY provider that does this to the this phone. Give us a break, Verizon, and let us decide how to use our phones!Overall this is a great phone with some relatively minor niggles. I have been pleased with it and it has been one of my better phones.",09-03-2007 00:00,195.170.178.0/24,1173398400,0,1,FN,0.06168224299065424
255,B000G7LWRM,Motorola RAZR V3m Silver Phone (Verizon Wireless),A3V89BKNY3JAE2,"Noodlehead ""Just a regular person""",2,"Had this phone (the new gray model from Verizon) for 10 days before taking it back. I loved the slim and stylish looks (a woman can actually wear it without bulk under a shirt, various toys (might someday use bluetooth, VCast etc but not right now) but the sound quality isn't that great. I noticed some fading in and out while listening to callers. This phone also dropped calls even in ordinary places like outside, and in a building with lots of windows. I only took 1 picture of my cat with the camera is fine. After about 10 days I noticed that the battery wouldn't hold a charge for more than 2 days even though the specs say it is much longer. I charged it last night and after only 8 hours on and 1 phone call it is already telling me that it has a low battery. Then when I open up the cover of the phone to dial a number I started having to press the numbers several times before it decided to register that I am pressing the keys. This just started happening today and that was the final straw in deciding to return it. Other things you should know is to activate vibrate only you have to press 2 keys and go through a menu series to get it to be vibrate only. This should be a one key event. Also when the speaker for the voice activated dialing comes on you must press the speaker to hear her say ""please say a command"" otherwise it is so low you probably won't be able to hear it. Also when you are dialing a number it is hard to do without looking at the keypad. The keypad numbers are not raised enough to allow this and it is very easy to press the wrong number or in my case, think you pressed 10 keys when only to find out I only did 9. One more thing that drives me crazy, is that it is always dirty and shows smudges very easily plus even after only 10 days, there is already dust under the screen. It doesn't clean up easy I am taking it back and having them reactivate my old LG phone. For the price of this phone you can do better. Looks spiffy but that's about it.",16-07-2006 00:00,195.177.218.0/23,1153008000,0,1,FN,0.06168224299065424

Sure, it's cute and light, but the phone is constantly dropping calls, gets TERRIBLE reception, decides not to ring when it feels like it and the battery life is about 36 hours with no talking and about 24 hours if you talk for about 1-2 hours (in battery save mode). I certainly would NOT recommend this phone to anyone. I had a Motorola before this which was absolutely wonderful, even after I dropped it in my dog's water dish! I thought this phone would be equally as great, but I'm very disappointed!! With my old phone I had perfect reception everywhere in my apartment, now I have to stand by the window and most times this phone won't ring in the apartment at all.The things that I do like over my old phone is the option to have true tones and it takes better pictures.

258,B000G7LWRM,Motorola RAZR V3m Silver Phone (Verizon Wireless),A2JCTFI1G9BJE7,Ellis Greene,1,"Admittedly, I don't use a tenth of the bells and whistles that this phone is supposed to have, I just want a phone. In that category, the Razor V3M falls horribly short.When the battery life in my LG4600 crept down to about half what it once was, I finally had an excuse to get a better looking, and hopefully better performing phone. The sales lady convinced me that the Razor was the best out there, so that's what I got. I was horrified to find that the brand new Razor battery lasted less than the half-strength LG that I had just gotten rid of!!!Pro's:1) It's a great looking phone. Of course, now EVERYONE has one in some form or another, so even that's not much of a pro now.2) Great big display! Very nice.Con's:1) MUCH worse reception than most phones I've had, just about everywhere I go.2) The battery life.3) Tinny-sounding speaker.4) Unlike just about every phone out there, you have to take it out of the plastic belt-clippy thing to open it for use, or charge it.5) Not loud enough. I sometimes have to put it on 'speaker phone', just to hear what's being said.6) Terribly user-unfriendly and counter-intuitive navigation menu. (8 selections to just initiate a text message?!? PLEASE!) In fairness, that may just be Verizon, not the V3M.7) Impossible to tuck between your shoulder and ear.

259,B000G7LWRM,Motorola RAZR V3m Silver Phone (Verizon Wireless),A2R2ZSAPDHZ9EU,FroZonE,5,"First off I did not buy this product at [...]I bought it from the [...]. I think this phone is a really, really nice verison of the razr, being that I've had 2 other razrs (v3 and v3i). This one feels a lot more sturdy in your hand, and it doesnt feel cheap as the v3 did, while maintaining its sleek, slim look, unlike the v3x which is a lot thicker. Furthermore, the camera on this razr is far superior to the previous versions, excluding the v3x(2 megapixels). It has a 1.3 megapixel camera, but I don't really use it for the camera, its only good for those surprise moments :P. Also I've noticed that the audio quality is a lot better than the other razrs, the songs/ringtones sound a lot more crisp and rich. Also the phonebook feature is fixed, I used to hate to have to wait like 30 seconds just to get to what contact I wanted (v3), Also new to this razr, is the voice command system, you can instantly look up numbers via voice command. You can also check battery levels, and signal strength. And the pause between letters in a text message is reduced, so no more waiting 2 seconds to type ""no"" :). Battery life is very much improved from the other razr models probably because this is a CDMA phone instead of the normal GSM razrs. A con however is the fact that if it gets scratched you will be able to easily tell it did, but I believe they offer this phone in silver if this is an issue. If you want to get really fancy you could get a custom case designed and handmade for your phone at vajacases.com.IF YOU BOUGHT THE VERIZON MUSIC ESSENTIALS KIT, OR THE VERIZON MOBILE OFFICE KIT, THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IS POINTLESS FOR YOU TO READ. For the rest of us who don't see giving Verizon more money on top of the phone price and service charge, read on.As for the hacking part as one person said previously, you can use bitpim to hack this phone. If you want to put music onto it without wasting more money on that Verizon software that allows you to do so, simply find p2k phone manager, MAKE SURE IT IS THE VERSION THAT WORKS WITH CDMA PHONES OR ELSE IT WILL NOT WORK. There are some tutorials that I found useful to help you through this, and when you're done hacking and stuff, you can have a lot of bonus features that Verizon disabled, such as music/ringtone transfer with MPT(Motorola Mobile Phone Tools), wireless bluetooth transfer, disabling the ringtones that come with it, changing the outer LCD screen. If you choose to do any of these, it will void your warranty, it is not illegal however. If mobile phone tools doesn't detect this phone, you may have the same problem I did, I was running an older version of the software. Also to enable music and ringtone transfer you have to use seem edits, which can be done with p2k phone manager. See, Verizon disabled the feature by making MPT think that the phone was a v3m when in fact the software has the device drivers listed as v3mm, also if those steps dont work after reading some tutorials, you may want to select v3c as your phone model. Another thing, the cable that comes with it that you're supposed to plug you headphones into, is FOR SMALL HEADPHONES, meaning its a 2.5mm jack instead of a 3.5, so YOU NEED SPECIAL HEADPHONES TO USE THAT FEATURE. But me being me, found a way around this. I used a knife to pry off the top part with the M logo on it and got to the insides. theres a circuit board and some wires connected to the jack. I used another phone jack from one of my broken CD players I had lying around. They're exactly the same connections and size (the smaller jack and the bigger one) so I put the bigger one on top of the smaller jack and soldered it to the bottom part, if you know what you're doing this shouldn't take more than half an hour. After I was finished I used an xacto blade to carefully cut the shape of the new phone jack out(because with two of them the cover wouldn't fit, and I wanted the bigger and the smaller jack). Then I had to also cut around the little part that holds the smaller hole at the bottom as to make it fit. After this was done I used some electrical tape(mostly because I wanted the adapter to stay black not gray with duck tape) and proceeded to wrap around it. Hopefully if you want to save like 50 bucks from buying the Verizon software you will try this, but then you need to buy the memory card and that will set you back like the same price haha, but you'll have like 512 mb instead of the 128 mb that comes in the Verizon package. Best of luck to all of you, and thank you for taking the time to read this.I hope this information has helped you, and if it did I would appreciate you rating this as helpful.",16-08-2006 00:00,195.178.116.0/23,1155686400,0,0,TN,0.5383177570093458
260,B000G7LWRM,Motorola RAZR V3m Silver Phone (Verizon Wireless),A2JCTFI1G9BJE7,Ellis Greene,1,"Pictures taken with this phone can be useless if you use Verizon Wireless. As other reviews point out, Verizon requires you to use its photo download service - you can't transfer files using Bluetooth or USB. That's annoying, but it's just the tip of the iceberg - Verizon has actually made it IMPOSSIBLE to get some of your pictures off the camera. That's because the phone takes pictures, apparently even using the default settings, that sometimes exceed the file size limit imposed by Verizon. For example, I have pictures -- including pictures of a graduation where I had forgotten my ""real"" camera -- that Verizon tells me can't be printed, can't be uploaded to the web, and can't be sent to anyone else. They are locked in my phone because Verizon has disabled file transfer software to prevent customers from, for example, buying ring tones from someone other than Verizon. So, to lock in ring tone sales, Verizon has locked my pictures in my phone. Compounding the problem, Verizon hasn't told its customer service personnel, or its technical support staff, who seem to be under instructions to blame Motorola. I wasted hours talking to Verizon people -- both in person at their repair office, and at their customer service line -- before finding out the truth on-line and getting someone at Verizon who admitted what's really going on. This would be a good phone, but Verizon has ruined it. If you want to use this phone as a camera, make sure you have a wireless provider that will let you access the photos you take.",02-11-2006 00:00,93.183.128.0/18,1134432000,1,1,FP,0.26168224299065423

The main reason I purchased it was because it's very thin and has no antenna. The reception is good and voices come in clear both ways. This is where the positives stop. The worst aspect of the phone is the poor battery life. I have even disabled EVDO so it won't switch between it and 1x when moving around town (which drains the battery).The Verizon software makes the phone useless. You cannot have the phone ring and vibrate at the same time, you cannot change the horrible wallpaper on the front LCD, and you cannot change the color scheme from red. Verizon has also disabled the use of Motorola Phone Tool, which enables you to put your own ringtones and media on the phone. You are forced to purchase media from the VCast service. Even if you wouldn't normally use media on your phone, you should object to this because of principal. It's corporate greed at its finest and Verizon is preventing you from using the full capabilities of your purchase.It does have a decent camera, but it's functionality is limited. It takes video clips, but nothing over 15 seconds. There are sites that tell you how to hack the phone, but it's not worth the time and risk of ruining the phone.The pluses: very thin, no antenna, sleek designCons: horrible user interface, very few options to change the appearance, many of the phone's functionality has been disabled by VerizonConclusion: buy something else.

That means, no interruptions when shutting of my phone (saves a lot of embarrasing moments at lectures or meetings). Also, DONT PAY TO DOWNLOAD RINGTONES.

I bought both the Motorola phone tools, data cable and phone only to find out that I could not do it. I also bought both my husband and I's phone's with a mini sd card to expand the memory so that we could use it as an mp3 player as they were originally portrayed on tv commercials.I switched to Verizon because a friend of mine said they had great signal and phones. Phones yes, signal, it's so so. I do love the phone though, it's slim (fits in my pocket), has a camera, plays songs and I like the features. I also was upset that Verizon blocks you from being able to transfer your own files, so I finally seem edited (which is hacked) the phone. It's actually pretty easy, and now we are able to transfer files between phone and pc, and we can see the main screen from the outside of the lcd.The speakerphone is a little low if you ask me, I wish it were louder and the menu's on the phone are a little different then most. I wish these were easier to use and you were able to edit more of the phone.

Good if it's outside, but not bad for a 1.3 megapixal. The camera is neat I think because I can take a few movies of the girls (I have two kids) and then transfer them to my computer for safe keeping. If you have the minisd card it's 5 minutes for a video...if not it's only 15 seconds (which is REALLY low).We also purchased the stereo headset where you can listen to music and answer the phone while doing it, it's something I recommend if you want to listen to music on your phone. It's not a bad player, but you can't do MP3's with verizon, they need to be converted to WMA files first and then transferred to be able to play them on the phone, which they are much bigger then MP3's.Overall, for the phone I give it five stars, but because it's with Verizon I only give it four.",25-03-2008 00:00,195.191.60.0/23,1206403200,0,0,FN,0.06168224299065424

Reception and call quality-by far and away better then my previous phone which was the samsung a950...i live in an area with bouncing reception...usually ill get anywhere from 1-3 bars and its constantly going back and forth between them..usually at even 0...especially in my room..no diffrence in call quality....very good reception...voice quality and sound even at 0 bars...i feel like im talking on my normal home phone and not a cell2. Size-a huge reason why i got this phone...seriously i can sometimes not tell my phones in my pocket and have to reach for it to make sure its there...which probably leads to some odd looks from others..lol3.expandable memory up to a gig-ive got over 13 albums of songs on here not to mention tons of pics and videos...id recommend picking up this card because youll fill up this phones internal memory fast...ive heard rumors about a 2 gig micro sd card working...nothings confirmed yet..motorola and verizon typically say up to a gig of space...4.vcast music- this is part of the cons to...however the vcast music player is exceptional on here...it gives you so many options as to how you want your music organized..very handy :)5.battery-can last a suprising amount of time despite is tiny battery size..expect to charge it daily though...gets good use overall :).Cons.1.Lack of Customization-It has the standard Verizon UI as mentioned above...also only one key on the phone is customizable...the down arrow...frustrating that you cant...i dont know...set them all to what you want them to do. Also outside lcd not changeable from ugly orange. that is unless your tech savvy and know about seem edits...but this requires hacking...hacking to change the outer display!2.no mp3 playback-yes...and there appears to be no fix for that in the near future...it basically requires you to spend another 30 bucks on the music essentials kit from verizon to convert all your songs to wma files....which isnt bad...however its a slight diffrence in sound quality..not to mention an annoying slight glitch youll hear in every song no matter what. Verizons rectified this problem with other past phones released with this conversion needed and has readded mp3 playback in recent releases...the v3m will most likely never see that fix...Sidenote:appearently this is a razr thing...not sure about the lg's or samsungs..but appearently verizon didnt totally erase evidence of the motorola ui on here as its more of a hybrid of the motorola ui overwritten by verizon...a nice touch really :).So theres my review of the razr v3m for verizon. I place call quality, reception and the size of this phone over customization and other complaints I have about this and well all verizon phones now. The tf slot and vcast music capability have really come in handy for me and its a highly used part of my phone. Don't let the cons get you down...you get used to it and I can only hope that verizons network coverage and quality make you as impressed as it has me :). This phone is definitly recommended for your purchase!Also of note I own the gunmetal grey v3m initially sold by verizon and not silver but theres no diffrenct between the two really :).",06-10-2006 00:00,195.228.11.0/24,1160092800,0,0,TN,0.5383177570093458

My main disappointment is the lack of battery life it has...3 hours is not a long time. My old Cingular phone allowed days of talk time before having to recharge. What good is a phone and plan if you can't use it longer than 3hrs of talk time and always worried you are going to lose connection. Other than that, the phone and features are great.",13-08-2006 00:00,195.228.43.0/24,1155427200,0,1,FN,0.13831775700934576
275,B000G7LWRM,Motorola RAZR V3m Silver Phone (Verizon Wireless),AQ9Q70N9I6ZKC,Oscar W.,5,"Well... I'm not one of those ""high tech"" guys that needs all the mp3 functions and/or the ability to upload music/picures to my phone. I love a phone that looks cool, has good sound, great basic features and the large screen doesn't hurt either. This phone has it all and I'm really happy with it.I just changed services from Sprint to Verizon and I couldn't be happier. The service I get when I am on the road is great. After a month and living in Houston, I haven't had any failures to connect or dropped calls. So far so good.The things I like about this phone...Regardless of what some have said about the ""lack"" of ringers included, I actually really like the few this has. There are some good fun ones and a couple generic (annoying) rings.This phone has an ""alarm"" setting, which my old Sprint phone did not have. Most phones have alarm settings now a days, but my old phone wasn't one of them. I've only used it once and it worked well for me.I LOVE the design. I'm a big guy with big hands and I love the fact that it feels as light and thin as a credit card. It has been said to be too ""wide"" for some people, but for my big hands it fits perfectly. All my other phones always felt just a little too small... like I was barely holding it with my fingertips. When I was trying out phones in the Verizon store, this one just seemed to feel the most comfortable to me.I love the screen. The menus are simple and easy to navigate through.NO ANTENNA!!! finally! I never understood why they didn't get rid of them sooner. My older phones had extendable antennas and they never helped. In fact, some of the time it made it worse if I extended it. Maybe it's the technology, but I love the fact there isn't a huge ""bump"" sticking out of my phone now.I enjoy the fact that as I sit here writing this review, my phone is plugged into my computer and charging with the same cable that I use for my digital camera. That's quite convenient and I don't even have to find an extra outlet at home to plug it into.The ""voice dialing"" is amazing. You don't even have to record any voice stuff (like I have on other phones). You just open the phone and click the button on the right side of the flip top. just say ""call joe blow"" and it'll ask to confirm, say ""yes"" and it dials. Super easy!The speaker phone is great. Very loud and the mic pics up from a few feet away, easily. I was using it just this morning while I was typing an e-mail and talking to a freind with the phone sitting on my desk next to me. I kept asking ""can you hear me"" and they'd say, ""yeah, loud and clear"". That makes me happy.I like that I can adjust the volume to turn it to ""silent"" without flipping the lid open.Lastly, I know I already said this, but the phone just looks super slick and cool. I love how it just slips into my pockets and doesn't feel like I'm carrying a huge boulder around in my shorts. It's light and easy to stash away.If I had to list off everything I don't like about this phone, I would not succeed in making it very long. There really isn't anything about this phone that I can say is ""bad"". If I were to be really picky, I'd say that it's probably very fragile. I'm not ""on the go"" with it that often and I'm usually stationary and/or indoors when I talk on it. I would assume that if dropped it could be damaged failry easily. I thought of this when I was considering buying it, so that's why I pay the extra $5/mo for the full equip. protection insurance on this baby. Can't be too careful. :)Also, the transfer of pictures you take from the phone to your computer??? I don't think this can be done. Some people have made points about how you can't upload/download from phone to computer, or vice versa... have to sign up for V-cast. That's a bummer, but I blocked it anyway... I can't aford the extra $16, or whatever it is, per month for that service. It's not worth it for me, personally.Lastly, of the negative pickiness I have for this phone, I do wish I could get rid of that stupid ""Verizon Wireless"" message that shows on the outside LCD and put something of my own there. That's me being REALLY picky here, but I have always been able to personalize the outter LCD on the other phones that I owned that had that.I hope my review was helpful to some. All I can really say to sum it up is that this phone was the hottest thing out there a little while ago and it's STILL a hot item. I have seen more people getting this phone now that prices dropped to make room for the new Chocolate and SLVR phones. I really liked the SLVR and almost got it instead, but I preferred a flip-phone over the non-flip. It's just a personal preference.I'm kind of a ""low maintinence"" guy with a fairly high maintinence phone, and I couldn't be happier with the RAZR!",24-08-2006 00:00,195.228.208.0/23,1156377600,0,0,TN,0.5383177570093458
276,B000G7LWRM,Motorola RAZR V3m Silver Phone (Verizon Wireless),AP7ZJ76KXPH1Z,Shannen Berry,3,"Bad things about the phone:Since when have you heard of a phone that doesn't vibrate and ring at the same time? Only vibrates or rings? I switched to this handset from a Motorola V551 and that one had some better features than this supposed upgrade.You can't customize the buttons to do what you want. For example, if you press the down key, it always goes to bluetooth options. In my other phone I had customized it to go to my contacts, but this phone does not let you change anything besides the ring tone and the wallpaper.There is an ugly red verizon bar at the top and bottom of your screen that can't be removed. Red does not match everything guys! There are only 3 color schemes, too.Speaking of which, Verizon charges for everything. They have the download option disabled so even if you do use the camera to take pictures you HAVE to email them to yourself, there is no other way to get them off your phone.1. No vibrate and ring, just vibrate or ring2. Very little customization3. Verizon has disabled all the file transfers except for when paying for airtime. RIP OFF4. Ugly verizon modifications that can't be removed off the screen.5. Takes forever to boot up, each button press is a little slow.6. Can't take a hit. If you drop it, the battery will pop out EVERY TIME!7. Can only record 15 seconds of video. I'm not sure if the additional memory helps this.8. You can't see what time it is when you're on a call! I don't know about you, but my cell phone doubles as my watch.9. There is no help prompts if you don't know what a function does.10. Uses BREW not java, so you wont find all the same games you might be used to.Good Things about the phone:1. It's very nice looking.2. The camera is pretty good for a camera phone.3. There is plenty of memory for pictures and text messages.4. You can store multiple numbers under one name5. The voice recognition is very good and works very well with bluetooth.6. The text message interface is excellent, maybe a few too many button presses though.7. Love the USB connection.8. Unlike some other Motorola phones, shows missed, dialed and received calls not just dialed and received.I switched from Cingular to Verizon and there are a few things I dislike about their service, but can live with.1.They bill you in advance. Tha's kind of weird considering I haven't made the calls yet. Maybe it's just the first month?2. They charge for incoming text messages. If you use yahoo or aim, those messages count as text messages instead of data. That's a rip off. What if I never read the text messages, am I still charged for them? I haven't quite figured that out.3. The service is the most expensive of all carriers and yet they charge for EVERYTHING.4. Their big service that they go on and on about, the EV-DOS highspeed Vcast, is not available in my area. Mobile web works fine though. Wish I had known that before.5. Vcast is $15 a month just for ACCESS to the service, once you get on, most multimedia items outside of news and weather cost a minimum of $1.99 each. What a rip off.Good things about their service:1. Their bill is clear and concise2. Their customer service is excellent.3. Network is really good. I can get calls in areas I couldn't with Cingular and other networks.Overall I'm happy with the phone and the service, just wish I knew these things in advance of purchase.",22-11-2006 00:00,195.230.0.0/19,1164153600,0,0,TN,0.13831775700934576
277,B000G7LWRM,Motorola RAZR V3m Silver Phone (Verizon Wireless),A2JCTFI1G9BJE7,Ellis Greene,1,"I am really mad! I was impressed with the looks of the phone and the Motorolla name; after all they invented the cell phone. But Moto is going the way of GM, to the brink of bankruptcy and they deserve to lose us - their customers. The phone quality is unusually bad. The worst thing is the very short battery life. You must have a charger in the car or anywhere you go. If you are in a place of no reception (inside a large building) the phone dies in 4-5 hours. If you have good reception, the phone would live for 1-1.5 days. But wait, that's not all. The camera is so bad it is useless. Fuzzy and dark. Besides, there is no way to download the pix anyway without letting Verizon rip you off. But wait, that's not all. The phone has music capability but you cannot use it because battery life is too short. Though anyway, no musing without paying Verison rip off money. But wait, that's not all. The software is so full of bugs it is simply unfinished. For example, if the alarm goes off and you are not there to stop, it will go until the phone dies. Normal phones stop after a minute. The calendar is also very ""buggy"" to use. Voice recognition is a also a waist of time.The one and only good thing is the GPS, but this is not specific to Motorolla and costs $10 per month.To summarize, avoid Motorolla and forget Verizon.",17-11-2006 00:00,93.183.128.0/18,1134432000,1,1,TP,0.26168224299065423

I assumed I would be getting another Motorola product with the same Motorola interface I've had for the last few years with my T720 and my V710. Unfortunately, Verizon has put their own user interface (VCAST) on all their phones in a blatant attempt to make the customer pay for pictures and tones. It really defeats the purpose of purchasing a Motorola product. If you think you are getting a Motorola phone with the traditional Motorola software you are sadly mistaken. At this point I'm so upset with Verizon that I plan to return the phone and switch to Cingular.",27-09-2006 00:00,195.234.138.0/24,1159315200,0,0,TN,0.26168224299065423

Foley,2,"My husband is on his third RAZR phone--the first one just stopped working after a while and the second died about a day after the warranty expired. The replacement was not free and required a contract extension. It's nice looking, small functions reasonably intuitively, and the bluetooth earpiece is nice, but it's a pretty fussy little thing. When I use it, I find I can't hear the caller it unless I have it positioned at just the right angle to my ear and I spend half the conversation looking for that sweet spot and asking people to repeat things. Also, some of the screen pixels seem to go sort of semi dead so that they look a bit greyed out at certain angles. For the price of this phone, I'm not very impressed.",09-07-2006 00:00,195.234.236.0/22,1152403200,0,0,TN,0.06168224299065424
280,B000G7LWRM,Motorola RAZR V3m Silver Phone (Verizon Wireless),A2US0QBGZ6BIMB,W. Hohauser,2,"Since I have to give this product some ""stars"" let me explain the reasoning for the three. I give 4 stars to Verizon's phone service (maybe not their customer service) since it consistently works better then other carriers in my neighborhood. I give 4 stars for the hardware design and the audio quality of the phone and 1 star for the software design. My previous phone was a Motorola V710 and it was a much easier phone to work with.After sound quality and reception quality (which this phone excels at) my next requirement is that the phone has a decent contact function and calendar function. Here the RAZR is a step back from previous generation phones. While I can successfully sync my contact list with my computer by Bluetooth or USB (which the V710 never could do properly), the RAZR no longer has a useful group function. I used to be able to group numbers into several categories and easily access them with the push of a button, not anymore. You can make contact groups but I can't find a way to access the groups. Every name is listed alphabetically by first name! That's not useful. The calendar is hidden down several menus. The V710 allowed you to change position of icons in each menu, not in the RAZR. The V710 also allowed you to scan different months easily. With the RAZR you have to repeatedly click thru the days to get to the next month. I also found out that the RAZR does not allow computers to sync to the calendar! Why not?One more complaint. If you are looking for a phone that first vibrates and then rings, skip this model. It's not programmed to do it!The camera is decent for a phone. I haven't tried the music player or the video playback and probably won't. The GPS is a nice function which will probably come in handy during my next car trip. The phone is a good size and fits in my hand well during phone calls. If the problems I have with the phone don't mean much to you then it's a good 4 stars.",21-04-2007 00:00,195.238.84.0/23,1177113600,0,0,TN,0.06168224299065424

While I like the design and functioning of the phone, I am very disappointed with it as a media device. I just destroyed a recently purchased 1gig Micro SD Card trying to remove it from the V3 slot. There is no way to get my music collection to and from my computer other than transfering this type card between my PC and the V3. The design and location of the Micro SD slot on the V3 is just awful.

I needed a phone ASAP. I can assur eyou all this phone is going back!I've always liked the look and coolness of the Razr, and figured it wasn't much different then the E815.Boy was I wrong!This phone isn't even in the same class! The E815 blows it away. But thanks Verizon, what do you do with peobably the best Motorola cell phone to date? Why of course, we cancel it!Of all fo the negatives your hearing here on Amazon--more specifically about the phone itself, I completely concur. Battery lif eon the phone seems like you'll get four to five calls max and then it's ready for a charge. What's worse is that I can't charge it and have an ear piece in at the same time. I know, I know, some of you are going to scream, ""Well why dont' you go out and get a Bluetooth?"" Well after losing my 4th Bluetooth in under 8 months, I've decided that experiment is now over.

Imagine my dismay when I discovered that it is impossible to transfer my image files to the computer by cable or BlueTooth.

301,B000G7LWRM,Motorola RAZR V3m Silver Phone (Verizon Wireless),A3LSLLR3OAJI7Y,Steven Metz,3,"I don't really care about the multimedia features--when I want music, I use my Ipod shuffle and when I want pictures, I use a digital camera--so I'll focus on the device as a phone rather than a music/video player or camera.Pros--The looks and size, of course. I don't like carrying a wireless on a belt clip so love to slip this baby in my shirt pocket--Nice, easy-to-read screen. I wouldn't want to watch TV on it, but that isn't why I buy a wireless phone.--VZ Navigator. This was what inspired me to switch from Cingular. It is a fantastic feature. I've tested it about ten times and it has been spot on, with accurate on-screen prompts, voice instructions, and estimated time of arrival. It turns me right into the driveway I need. If you miss a turn, it recalculates new instructions in a matter of seconds. The only down side is that it works from the quickest route and has no way for you to override that. For instance, I went to friend's house and it had me get on a toll road for a few miles. This WAS the shortest route, but not one I would normally have taken.--Voice recognition system works great. It doesn't have to be ""taught"" and can access all items in the contact list, prepare a blank text message, or dial a dictated number--Clearest calls I've had in a wireless phone. You sometimes hear ""the people I'm talking to can't tell I'm on a wireless."" That's been my experience with this handset.Cons--Strength of reception not quite as good as a handset with an external antenna, even a stubby one.--I wish they hadn't taken away the vibrate+ring option. The Razr has to be either on vibrate with no sound or ring. I also wish there was some sort of external LED to indicate when I missed a call or have voice mail. As is, you have to open the Razr to check this. An NEC handset I had a few years ago had very nice system with different color LEDs.--Verizon's proprietary menu system is more difficult to use than the organic Motorola one and takes away some customization options such as setting hot keys. I also haven't found a way to turn off unnecessary prompts (""Do you really want to delete this missed call?""). There is also no way (at least that I have found) to change the red band at the top and bottom of the screen. It only looks decent with some sort of red wallpaper.--Verizon has the phone locked down so it's difficult or impossible to add pictures and ringtones without paying them.--It's plastic (the Amazon review is just plain wrong on this point). I wish there was still the option of buying a metal Razr like the first generation ones. I would have paid extra for it. Like all phones, I'm sure it will scratch with use and be more susceptible to breaking.--I could not synchronize the built in calendar with Outlook. I subscribed to a separate calendar synchronization program from Verizon (iDatebook) which works well but creates a separate calendar rather than using the built in one.--The Razr uses BREW for applications so there are fewer available than in java. I particularly miss World Mate for international travel (especially the currency converter) and a shopping list application.--It's CMDA only so for for international travel, I've had to unlock an old handset and will just buy prepaid SIMsAll in all, though, the V3m may be my favorite wireless handset of the seven I've owned over the years.",12-07-2006 00:00,212.70.128.0/19,1152662400,0,0,TN,0.13831775700934576
302,B000G7LWRM,Motorola RAZR V3m Silver Phone (Verizon Wireless),A2JCTFI1G9BJE7,Ellis Greene,2,"I've been using this thing for about a week now, and it's a big upgrade from my near-giveaway Ericsson T316. I strongly recommend a case, since the housing of the current-generation Razr is plastic (earlier versions were encased in metal). Unfortunately, this increases the bulk of the device, when one of its draws is the slim design. I opted for the Verizon-branded Verizon leather dealie, which is custom-fitted for the phone. Unfortunately, the belt clip cannot be removed from the leather case, short of brute force.Also, the camera is nice, but Verizon has disabled the Razr's OBEX feature, which allows you to transfer things between your phone and a computer -- like photos, ringtones, wallpaper, et cetera. You have to pay an additional fee to email pictures to yourself or someone else, which is irritating. There are ways around this, but they void the warranty and may damage your phone's firmware, possibly rendering it unusable. In fact, even *entering* the phone's test mode will void your warranty. I find this a little condescending and authoritarian for something I bought and paid for.I have to say I'm tempted to try, though, since Verizon wants me to pay $2.99 USD per additional ringtone, which is honestly ridiculous. (There may be cheaper ringtones, but that was the price point I saw on all tones I found via their ""Get It Now"" service.)Since the phone is incredibly popular, you should have no trouble finding an online community for advice, some support, and helpful tips. And there are loads of accessories, including a wireless Bluetooth headset with voice command recognition. Unfortunately, Bluetooth isn't a very secure protocol. To their credit, Verizon mentions this fact in the manual.What I didn't notice in the manual was the fact that the phone is apparently disabled when in recharge mode. This morning I was almost late to work because the phone's alarm clock didn't go off. With the T316, I could plug it in at the end of the day, go to bed, and wake up with a fully charged phone blaring its alarm at me. The T316, like most phones, also does vibration and ringing simultaneously, while the V3M does not. This is a curious omission, especially at this price point, but it's not a deal-breaker, for me.Lastly, I had to dig through several pieces of documentation before I discovered that I had to call a special 3-digit number to actually activate my phone -- and this must be done every 30 days or so, a fact I *never* saw anywhere in their product descriptions. And the notifications on the phone's screen don't clearly indicate when activation has completed, at which point I can safely disconnect the call. I believe only Verizon requires you to literally phone home on a periodic basis.I would much prefer a notification prompt that a network or phone upgrade is available, rather than having to call Daddy VZ every few weeks to check in and let him know that Little Johnny Subscriber is alive and well. The way I see it, I pay them my monthly fee, and they let me do my thing. I'll call them if I need something. Otherwise, let's just be friends, okay?It's a nice-looking, widely supported device with solid sound quality, but Verizon's attitude towards the user experience is disappointing. OBEX is standard in the Razr phone -- don't break it and tell me I'm not allowed to fix it, and don't offer me (IMO) overpriced items and services to compensate. It's too bad that the user experience can be affected so much by who you use as a service provider.",29-08-2006 00:00,212.72.192.0/19,1156809600,0,0,TN,0.06168224299065424

There is a camera shortcut on the keypad that takes you to the camera mode.My main problem with this phone is that Verizon have disabled bluetooth file transfer.

I bought it because it was one of the only Verizon phones that seemed likely to work with my Macintosh and iSync to transfer contacts over Bluetooth. While I had mixed success in that regard there is lots of other things about this phone to not recommend it.As for the physical form; the screen is an absolute blank outdoors in any kind of sunlight, the speaker phone key on the side is easy to accidently activate and I was constantly broadcasting my calls to everybody until I learned to be more careful, the same thing with the voice menu key on the other side, and the center select button on the 4-way navigation key is very difficult to push for anybody with fingers larger than Barbie (I had some success using my fingernails until I trimmed them).The user interface is horrible and I wonder if anybody actually tests these things; it can play music and take pictures but still has only one lousy field for the contact name (forget about sorting by last name or trying to keep track of a contact by their company name), all contacts get assigned speed dials and they must be moved, not deleted (very tedious to organize and so I only did it for the first 10 or so speed dials), you don't know for sure what speed dial number you are calling until the call has been initiated (unlike my old phone that would display the contact before making the call; I know they are speed dials but I don't always remember which number I assigned), it takes several key presses to activate ""vibrate only"" (as opposed to one convenient key press on my old phone), get used to the ""get it now menu"" and the ""mobile web"" because most of the navigation keys manage to take you there (there is only one assignable navigation key press and it can't be ""recent calls"", something I used a lot on my old, uncool phone) , backing out of menus is inconsistent (sometimes it is a soft key, sometimes the clear key, sometimes the end key), assignments made for speed dial or custom ringtones don't always seem to stick (for instance, the speed dial number seems to work as assigned but the ""contacts"" listing shows a different speed dial), and the ""iTap"" predictive text entry mode is a joke (producing nothing but esperanto for my simple messages). That is enough for now but I could go on.I was able to transfer my contacts to the phone using iSync but I did not try anything with the calendar. Besides the name limitation mentioned above, only ""mobile"", ""home"" and ""work"" numbers are recognized (in addition to email and fax). A subsequent sync overwrote all my speed dial assignments. Given the difficulties with that feature (see above) I don't think I will do that again soon.The voice quality and reception are good but using this phone is frustrating.",16-09-2006 00:00,212.75.0.0/19,1158364800,0,1,FN,0.26168224299065423

It's very thin, not even noticeable in my pants pocket until I reach in and ""feel around"" for it. The phone part works fine, it offers Bluetooth headset support, doesn't have an ugly antenna sticking out, has a speakerphone coming out the rear end that sorta works (nothing like the LG 4650), offers a color LCD on the front panel, has a built-in camera (that, unfortunately, looks awful), charges and connects to a PC via USB, and offers EDVO high-speed internet access for its built-in web browser.And then Motorola took the device and sold it to Verizon Wireless. Verizon then passed it to their profiteering executives and evaluated the feature set. ""File transfer? Kill it! Forget about transferring memos and photos from the phone; make 'em pay messaging fees to e-mail that crap to their home computers. Nobody needs to transfer binary stuff unless they're going to save photos taken with the camera, in which case our e-mail system works FINE, screw USB and Bluetooth. As for bringing stuff up to the device, call it a music phone, build it around music, but make 'em pay. Yeah, paint the whole user interface blood-red and put 'V-Cast' graffiti all over it. Make 'em download songs for $2 per song. But don't let 'em actually use stereo Bluetooth heaphones for listening to music. No, make 'em use the speakerphone for the music. It's OUR phone, anyway, and we can dictate what our customers can and can't do all we want. Oh, and national access? Kill it! Broadband access? Hahaha!! Come to think of it, to top it all off, just let them burn in hell if they ever do anything USEFUL with the phone besides use it as a phone, take crappy pictures that can only be stored locally or be sent via e-mail, or download music off of V-Cast.

Please read this and rate well and keep it at the top so that others can be fairly warned before buying (or not, hopefully!)Barring the keypad defectiveness for which I've had NO END of hassle with amazon in trying to 1. get a replacement phone sent 2. get the rebates which are now expired due to the time it took to get the replacement and 3. hassle with VERIZON over the same things, here is my evaluation of this phone:I thought something was WRONG with this phone, the way it drains the battery. This is the most important flaw. I've never seen a phone that eats battery as this one does. (Amazon negative: When I called Amazon to return it, I tried to EXCHANGE it for a different one and THEY DON'T EXCHANGE CELL PHONES. Let everyone be aware and ware of this. NO CELL PHONE EXCHANGES. They will REPLACE a phone if it is defective, but no EXCHANGES! They don't say that when you purchase.) I am now buying an extended battery (AND a new door, you have to buy the door for the pink one separately because they don't sell it anywhere else than Motorola Website) for a total of about 65$ more.Secondly, both Razrs (the original and replacement) experience keypad freezing. The replacement only once, when typing a txt msg. The original would freeze continually, once it froze when the alarm clock was going off and I had to take the battery out for it to stop!Third: The sound. The volume when in a call is really bad. It is so very hard to hear on this phone, with the volume turned all the way up.Fourth: you can't CHARGE the phone and talk on a 2.5mm headset at the same time. This phone has ONE mini-USB port and comes with a wall-charger and an adapter for a 2.5mm headset. But if you have a 2.5mm headset because you don't like Bluetooth (because it's yet another gadget you can't hear very well on and can't remember to charge), no charging the phone while you talk!Fifth: the way Verizon ties up the ability to use this phone is SHOCKING. They seriously are vultures about it. They try to make you pay for everything they can, mobile office kits, ringtones, downloading photos to your phone or sending. It's 25 cents per picture message unless you have a picture message plan!! (DON'T BUY MOBILE OFFICE KIT (another 40$), instead buy a microSD card and reader and get the pictures and txt items from there).I hope that if you are thinking of 1. verizon or 2. motorola razr you will think again, because you are asking for hassle, stress, a phone that ALWAYS needs charging and makes you nervous to talk because it will drain the battery.

309,B000G7LWRM,Motorola RAZR V3m Silver Phone (Verizon Wireless),A30PZ4IT4Q0YX3,"G. A. Subramanian ""GKS""",1,"This is a good phone that was messed up by Verizon.You can't transfer your files from the phone to your computer. Verizon wants you to pay them for the privelage and use their network to transfer.If you were to ever call them and ask them about it they are GREAT at Passing the buck.Even though you may have bought the phone in a verizon store from verizon they say it is motorolla's fault that you can't transfer your pictures. Despite the fact that their version of the RAZR is the only version that is crippled in this way.Furthermore they have made it so that you can't change the red colors that permeate the interface. This is just adding insult to injury. If you want to add your own custom ringtones, there are two ways, the easiest of course is to pay verizon money to send it to your phone. Other ways are hacks that sometimes work and sometimes don't. Also you can't make the phone vibrate and ring at the same time. My ancient nokia, that I had in 2000 did this and so has every other phone I've owned since. I don't even understand why Verizon would disable this.There is one feature I'm am not totally happy with, that is not Verizons fault(as far as I know, but I wouldn't be surprised). The camera takes the crappy pictures you would expect from a phone. Unless your hands are shaky like mine. In that case it will take pictures even crappier than what you would expect from a phone.The phone itself is slick. It's thin, the ergonomics are better than any other. Verizons voice calling features are great. The fact that the address book interface is clunky doesn't matter one bit when you can just tell your phone who to call. You can whip it out and dial all with one hand. Then have it on the speaker phone while you are waiting for someone to pick up. As a phone it's hard to beat, but these days I think we are allowed to expect more.The saddest part is that it's my favorite phone from the company with the best network, you really can't win.",29-09-2006 00:00,212.116.128.0/19,1159488000,0,0,FN,0.26168224299065423

Like most of you, when this came out I really, really wanted one, but they were just too pricey. Now the price is within reason, so I went for it and extended my plan.I'm not sure what all the complaints are about. The phone is very thin and once in your pocket you hardly know it's there, and the lack of an external antenna makes it much easier to get out of your pocket. It has a nice feel to it and is wide enough so it doesn't feel like a toy. I have very small hands and have little trouble working everything with one hand. The ""flat"" buttons don't bother me, but I wish the OK button in the middle of the toggle ring was raised up just a bit. I find myself using my thumbnail to press it.I'm having no trouble with hearing people, and the ringers are just loud enough for me. The complaint about several button being located on the flip up cover are not a real problem. If they were on the lower part of the phone you would be pressing them all the time.Yes, the screen is difficult to see in bright daylight, but aren't they all, including most cameras and PDA's.The voice activation feature worked right away, after installing some contacts, and made few mistakes.I also got the GPS Maps feature and the Web option. I have not had a chance to really test the GPS, but it did locate my position within a house or two. The Web option seems to work very well and I was able to get lots of info quite easily and rather quickly.I did spend some time with Verizon on the phone to learn how to activate these features and learn how to use them, but I've always found Verizon service to be excellent, and the person stayed with me until I had all the features down.I was told that the Razr has gone through some software changes and unlike the stories I've heard, the top does not feel like it's going to fly off the phone across the room. It feels really solid considering how thin it is.I would say if you've been waiting now is the time. It looks like they've gotten some of the bugs out of the phone, and while it does take awhile to get over the learning curve, for any advance features, I really like this phone a lot.Is it perfect? Not at all, but it is extremely popular, and it's been around long enough so you can find just about anything for this phone on the Net.I would have given it 5 stars, but it's just confusing enough learning how to use it I had to give it 4.Also, like others have said: If you want a decent camera get a decent camera. If you want a decent PDA get a decent PDA. If you want an iPod get an iPod. This is a very good phone with lots of extra features, but it's not perfect.

The CDMA network sucks electricity out of the phone like a vampire!They say: ""200 hours standby"" vs ""400 hours standby"" on a GSM Razr.Your actual time may vary.My actual battery life was: 20 minutes of use within a 28 hour period of standing by, and the phone was beeping loudly that the battery was completely dead! And No, I did not listen to any music, or watch Vcast, or anything like that.difference #2:Bluetooth:Verizon shuts off the OBEX portion of the bluetooth that Motorola put into the phone when they built it.What that means is: You can not transfer anything to or from the handset via bluetooth. Take a picture, or video? Pay us to email it to yourself. Music? Your Own Ringtones? Buy those from us too.One note: I did not get mine from Amazon, I got it from Verizon directly.Verizon's customer service is also very lame.

319,B000G7LWRM,Motorola RAZR V3m Silver Phone (Verizon Wireless),AFK0YQ3CMG9NH,"Jenny Mulligan ""rcminnc""",3,"The Motorazr V3m is a solid phone- making and recieving calls is easy and effective, the operating system is consistent, and it looks small and stylish on the outside. However, once you go beyond simple phone tasks, things get more complicated.First, the exterior: it is sleek and thin, and looks very good. One problem is that the outside tends to smudge, but this can be corrected by wiping the phone off. The keys are nice, which is amazing because they are so thin. The d-pad in the middle is a little hard to use, though- the phone could have used a little more space around it.As for basic features, almost everything is very accessible and intuitive (with the exception of the camera, which is hard to get to from the menus). The contacts software allows you to add multiple numbers for one entry at once, which is a bonus. Settings are easy to find and change. Messages are straight-foward, however, if you miss more than one message and then say ""yes"" at the screen that asks if you want to check them, you are taken to the newest message, which can be confusing if the earlier message is connected to it.Now, the extra features that Verizon advertises are the disappointing part. I know this is common for phones, but just remember that what is advertised does not come with the phone for free. You must pay pretty hefty fees for web browzing, Vcast (video service), downloading ringtones and using the navigation system. Even the games are only demos and can only be used once. I have tried the navigation software as well as the browser, and both are top-quality. It is up to you to decide whether you want to pay the fees ($10/mth and $6/mth respectively). Music is also difficult to transfer from your PC- I have had no success trying a USB cord I had at home, so you might need to spend another $20 to get the propritary cord. The bluetooth software with the phone does not support file transfer.Overall, a good phone for everyday needs, just make sure you know what you are getting into.",24-05-2007 00:00,213.169.32.0/19,1179964800,0,0,FN,0.13831775700934576

The phone has dropped out of the holster and onto concrete five times in the first month alone. What was Motorola thinking. I'll never but another phone without first making sure it has a suitable holster.Feature-wise, the camera is a novelty that I've used a handful of times the first week. I dont care about novelties or gimmicks, I care that the signal is clear, and the phone has worked well in that regard.I may ultimately deactivate thie phone and switch back to my old phone; we'll see if it survives a few more falls out of the holster onto concrete.---------Original Review:My ""old"" phone was smaller, this phone is huge. Yes it's flat, but it's almost three times the width.There are too many nonsensical features that do not aid or improve the act of making a phone call (video, camera, music, etc).One surprisingly nice feature is the voice recognition (""Call Joe Mobile"") which works very well. Wouldn't have thought that would be a useful feature, but it works great. The main screen is very good, with plenty of resolution to handle long contact names, and the software displays pseudo scrollbars to indicate more content is offscreen (nice touch).The LCD on the outside is redundant, and removing that should help make the phone smaller (and cheaper).The ""holster"" does not come with the phone, and Verizon wanted twenty bucks. Several types are available online for 1/3 the price, but none of them (including the Verizon version) work as good as the free holster that came with my ""old"" phone.The battery only lasts 2 days (with 1-2 calls a day, and NO game playing or picture taking).While the phone is beautiful, and an engineering design masterpiece (looks sexy), it's too big, and was designed more to look at, than to be carried by a human. It's almost too large for a holster (hits your leg when sitting) and is awkward to hold while making a call. Motorola should look back at their StarTac phone, which was designed with the holster in mind, and was smaller than the RAZR.Overall not bad, but Motorola (and others) could use a ""less is more"" approach to their phones.",10-08-2006 00:00,213.191.192.0/19,1155168000,0,0,FN,0.13831775700934576

From the time you press the on button till you can make or receive a call is well over 1 minute. Therefore, if you are like me and don't use your cellphone every minute of your life and actually turn it off every once in a while you better hope you don't need to make an emergency call because you will likely be unconscious before this thing turns on. My 3 year old Nokia I had from Cingular turned on and could place a call within 5 seconds, beat that Razr.The second problem is that when you turn the phone off it makes a stupid sound that cannot be turned off or muted and is quite annoying.The thinness of the phone causes your hand to cramp up after about two minutes of use.The display on this phone sucks and is impossible to see in sunlight no matter which way you try to face it. The outer display doesn't even show when the phone is not in use and gets annoying when you try to use it as a clock and have to open it everytime.Battery life is horrible, it lasted about 1 hour and 15 minutes for me on a fully charged battery until it died, this is unacceptable in my book.Sound quality is very poor and whenever you talk into it you hear your own voice in the ear part of the phone which gets really annoying after about one minute.Reception is certainly not the best, the Motorola E815 that I got now gets full reception in places that this thing couldn't even find a signal.The interface is ugly and cannot be changed the red verizon bars on the top and bottom need to go and I like Motorolas interface much better.The OK button needs to be changed so that it is raised up or something because everytime you try to hit it you end up hitting one of the arrows instead.So there you have it that is why I didn't like this phone at all and returned it after two days for an E815 which by the way I am more than happy with. If you want a phone that makes and receives calls with good clarity and reception (which is what a phone is designed for) this is definitely not for you.

No antenna was a nice plus as well. I really regret buying this phone!!! My biggest upset was the battery life. The day I recieved the phone I charged it and was ready to go. I made one THIRTEEN MIN phone call and it already needed to be charged. I went two or three days with the same thing happening and I finally took it back to the store. They(verizon) told me this was common with this phone and that I would have to buy a new and better $[...] battery. Needless to say I keep the one I had and it hasn't got any better. I only make 4 or 5 calls a day with no more than an hour usage and have to charge it twice a day. I dropped it(on carpet) and the display screen doesnt work anymore. The only upside to this phone is that its slender. I repeat Please Don't Waste Your Money!,21-10-2007 00:00,212.233.128.0/17,1175644800,1,1,TP,0.26168224299065423
330,B000G7LWRM,Motorola RAZR V3m Silver Phone (Verizon Wireless),A2E22X66GGRHBH,Kristina Diy,4,"I replaced a Motorola v265 with this phone. I was extremely disappointed by the fact that this phone is made of plastic, not metal. The speakerphone is indeed not loud enough; it's quieter than any other speakerphone I've ever heard. The directional pad is too small for my average-sized hands, and requires me to use my fingertips, which is annoying most of the time. The button travel is a bit deep, but I suppose that it prevents accidental pressing.My phone has been hacked as mentioned in other reviews, so I am no longer forced to download ringtone$ and graphic$ from Verizon. Yes, I voided my phone's warranty by doing this, but these phones have been around for years, and they're pretty reliable. I also added a 1GB Micro-SD card, and the phone works fairly well as an MP3 player (playlists are supported). MP3s must be synced from Windows Media Player 10, but it's a very simple process. A standard 5-pin USB cable will allow this phone to interface with a PC.It's best to install a Micro-SD card in this phone with the intention of never removing it. You'll probably damage something while trying. The positive side is that the card will not budge if you drop your phone.The built-in 1.3 megapixel camera compares with my ancient 1.2 megapixel camera. You won't take breathtaking works of art with it, but the picture quality is half-decent. The video camera produces similar webcam-quality results.The real point of this phone is its aesthetic appeal. It's thin enough that you can keep it in your pocket without being bothered by the bulge. It looks good when you pull it out, and the shape and materials feel good when you're using it. It's not cutting-edge anymore, but it costs a lot less than a Blackberry, and if you're willing to hack it (voiding warranty), it provides a satisfying amount of gadgetry.UPDATE: I tried modifying another Razr V3m in an identical fashion. The USB connection was loose, and the phone became disconnected from the computer during the modification. That phone is now a paperweight.

My only complaint is with Verizon. Motorola manufactured a phone that can be hooked up to your computer with a simple USB cord, making it easy to load your own pictures, wallpaper, ringtones, or whatever. Verizon has blocked this ability on the phones they sell! They want you to have to pay them to send pictures to yourself, and to have to buy ringtones. Why should I pay them $2 to $3 each for tiny snippets of songs that I already own, or could buy from iTunes for 99 cents for the whole song?!The phone can be hacked (there are instructions all over the net), but you can fry your phone if you don't hack it properly, and the hacking voids your warranty, so if you're not pretty tech-savvy and you really want this phone, I'd STRONGLY advise that you go with another carrier that doesn't disable the phone's capabilities.

The camera can take 1 megapixel images that get locked into your phone unless you subscribe to the optional text and image plan.

The Verizon interface makes it awkward to use the music features and you will need USB headphones for additional money (again).While my older Motorola phone was able to use Verizon's national access to connect my computer to the internet (14.4k with no additional charge except minutes used, slow but useful), the V3m has disabled this feature and requires you to subscribe to a data plan for... more money (again).In theory, voice dialing will allow you to use a voice command to call any number in the directory. It hasn't been perfected. If you say, ""call Mary"", the phone is just as likely to call Harry.Although Verizon boasts about their network, this phone has been unable to connect in transportation hubs like New York's Grand Central Terminal and Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport.

If you gotta have a V3m, get one from another carrier.The Razr V3m's sharp looks, respectable battery life and fidelity are marred by Verizon's sluggish interface and crippled features. If all you want is a thin profiled phone, then you'll probably be happy with this item - and many places offer them up for free. But those searching for a ""media"" rich phone should keep looking.The ""IN"" calling feature can save you a bundle if friends and family are Verizon subscribers. BUT...If you are at all interested in customizing the V3m with ringtones, wallpaper and such, be prepared to hand fistfulls of cash to the VCAST service or spend oodles of time trolling the net for info on hacks (of which there are plenty - for Windows users).The built-in camera is just okay. With the placement of the lens near the hinge you're bound to end up with an index finger in many a shot. The same holds true for the video camera feature - not that you'll use it much since its record time is limited to 15 seconds.You can playback .wma files stored on a transflash card (that's next to the battery that must be removed to access the card) but there's no 3.5mm headphone port; A USB dongle adapter is in box.

By mid afternoon the phone keeps beeping for a recharge, even though all other features except standby are switched off. Even simply leaving it off-charge, in standby mode for most of the day, seems to drain the battery at least 1/2 way on the screen meter.What I resent most is Verizon's pretense there is nothing wrong, or that I should leave it on-charge all the time. Because of this lack of honesty I have wasted time going back to the Verizon office to swap out the battery after a week, and then gone to Verizon again to swap the whole phone a week later.Meantime, I just spent 18 months using one of the original Razr V3s with a GSM carrier. which has excellent battery life. Throughout the whole period I barely ever drained the battery, even after leaving it off-charge on standby throughout most weekends.Think very seriously about insisting Verizon upgrade the battery for free when you buy this phone.

350,B000MSBUZO,Motorola RAZR V3xx GSM 3G Used Cell Phone AT&T,ANBP6PGU6I5H8,"R. Eckenrod ""reckenrod""",5,"For years, ever since the ""old school"" days, my cell phone of choice was always a Nokia until about three years ago, when I opted to upgrade to a Motorola v551. While overall, the v551 was a nice phone, there were some Motorola quirks that really soured me on considering a new Motorola device.So, when the time came again to upgrade my device, I started to do some real reserach to find an all around good phone. I considered waiting for the new iPhone, but couldn't see plunking down $600 on a non-3G capable phone (first generation to boot). Nokia's were out simply because many of them are not flip phones and even the ones that are weren't aesthetically pleasing. Compounding my problem even further was the fact that even though the RAZR's looked nice, I read way too many reviews that highlighted its many shortcomings. And, it was a Motorola, plagued with the same quirks that I had hated (one example, the fact that I had to create a separate contact for every phone number I entered, even if it was for the same person, another was photo quality and yet another was the charger.)After reading the reviews for the V3xx, I was intrigued. For one, Motorola revamped its operating system, making it more user friendly. Secondly, the v3xx was 3G capable, had a powerful camera, and could be used as an MP3 device. These were the things I was looking for, and after reading the reviews, I figured I'd give Motorola another chance.I've had the phone for three days now and I'm very pleased. It has a nice sturdy feel to it, the buttons and ""joystick"" are easily used and feel solid. The display is very sharp, it takes great photos and has a few photo tools to help make your picture look good. The reception is also very good and phone calls sound crystal clear. The speakerphone is average, sounding just like most speaker phones do (like a tin can.) The internet browser, with the 3G capability, is great and I can actually see myself using the media features as opposed to having it simply as a novelty like I did on the v551. The streaming video and music is great and I hope that Cingual expands the selection of titles as well as length of programming.I still have yet to try the mobile e-mail function and the mp3 player, but I don't have any doubts that they will perform well also. To be a semi-serious mp3 player, a micro SD card is essential, as well as either a bluetooth hedaset or a 3.5mm adapter.Perhaps the only gripe I can come up with at this time is the outside display is not as bright as it could be, and I find myself having to look very hard to see what time it is or whether I had missed a call. On the v551, the display would light up bright blue and even when dimmed, the time was still easy to see during the day.To sum up, if you're considering a phone that that doesn't require serious business use, give the V3xx a try. I'm very pleased with my purchase.",01-06-2007 00:00,46.99.252.0/22,1180656000,0,0,TN,0.15
351,B000MSBUZO,Motorola RAZR V3xx GSM 3G Used Cell Phone AT&T,A2LAWORUDFHOVD,JD,3,"I really had high hopes for this phone. Previously I had a cingular v3 for 2 years and couldn't have been happier with that phone. So, in looking for a new phone, naturally I went with the v3xx because of the 3g network, new screen, sd slot, and all the new features. Everything was great with the phone, screen is awesome, data transfer is quick, phone looks great, but I could not get over the most important thing in a phone: call quality.Experienced terrible reception with this phone, numerous dropped calls, and being in downtown L.A., I'm not sure of the reason. I'm on my second unit and still experienced the same issues. Dropped calls + voice distortion to the point where i was asking people to repeat certain words several times a minute. I suspect it mostly occured when the phone was switching from 3G to Edge, or vice versa as I experienced the worst reception and call quality when I noticed the network icon switching back and forth. Needless to say, I'll be returing this to amazon, perhaps looking to another carrier and settling with edge network, instead of 3g. I see other people are completely happy with this phone, so I guess reception and phone quality greatly varies, and maybe my gripe is more with the network than the phone as everything else with the phone was excellent.",18-06-2007 00:00,46.183.120.0/21,1182124800,0,1,FN,0.25
352,B000MSBUZO,Motorola RAZR V3xx GSM 3G Used Cell Phone AT&T,AH2P5F2I0KP4E,W. Gardner,4,"I have changed to GSM and selected the V3xx phone as the Motoroal V60 was the best phone I have ever owned. The Razr V3xx has some short commings that anyone considering it should know about. First of all you have to have the phone really centered on your ear to hear it at its best 1/4 inch makes a difference. The front screen is too small to read incoming call numbers, so it is useless for caller ID. Both inside and external screens are hard to read in bright sunlight. The srceens are great in reduced light or indoors. The start call(green) and end call(red) buttons are right next to buttons that start the AT&T browser or CV both of which will cost you if you press one by mistake and cancel as quickly as posible, you learn to look at the buttons you are pressing, not a good idea if you are driving. I have not been able to find a good blue tooth device to use while driving. I have purchased two units with built in speakers and three ear piece devices. The best is the Motorola H700 (I bought it from Amazon to avoid fake look alikes and the $99.00 asked by AT&T). The H700 is scratchy but usable in a car. The quality and volume of the blue tooth on any of the devices I have tried is about equal to the built in speaker. The last issue with the phone is battery life, if I am lucky I get two days charge on a battery. I probably place or receive four to five short calls a day.

I haven't downloaded music yet so can't comment on that aspect.

Amazon gave me the run-around for over two weeks. Finally, i took the phone into an AT&T; store. They informed me that is was most definitely a REFURBISHED phone. They also told me the reason there were so many problems activating the number is because the phone number BELONGED TO SOMEONE ELSE! I called Amazon to discuss the fact they had sent me a refurbished phone when I had bought a NEW phone, and they did not have an answer. The very nice customer service representative said that he would have someone email me back (because the cell phone specialty department did NOT make any calls). It's been two weeks and I still do not have an explanation as to why I was sent a refurbished phone or why I was assigned a number which was already assigned to someone else.DO NOT buy phones from Amazon.

We had a problem with the keyboard and called for warranty service and they said that the warranty is invalid if there is any water damage. We explained that there was no water damage, it just stopped working. They asked us to check a ""dot"" sensor on the phone. If the dot is red, the warranty is invalid. We asked how the dot could be red when the phone (2 months old) never got wet, and their rep told us that rain, sweat or being exposed to humidity or condensation! An unscientific survy of razr uses at a soccer game found 4 of 5 with the dot turned red-and hense no warranty.So bottom line is, it is a good phone, as long as you don't sweat or live in a location where it rains or gets humid.",14-09-2007 00:00,77.247.88.0/21,1189728000,0,0,TN,0.65

Coupled with an unlimited data plan, this is an absolutely stellar phone.Users of past RAZR and similar Motorola phones almost won't recognize the OS. It's been hugely improved in almost every area - camera, media, address book, messaging, storage (including a a Transflash slot). It's also very snappy. Hardware-wise, the screen is bumped from the old 176x220 to 240x320 (QVGA). It's silky smooth and bright.If you live in a Cingular 3G area, the HSDPA data is amazingly fast, and the voice quality is orders of magnitude better than any cell phone I've tried before - crystal clear. The built in browser is okay, but it really shines with the free Opera Mini browser.The only disappointing thing is that Cingular has crippled the network access for Java applications. Using a non-Cingular Java application such as Opera Mini will have the phone asking your permission to access the network every single network request it makes. This gets really frustrating really fast, but a fix can be found with a little bit of googling.Don't bother with this if you don't get the data plan... get a KRZR instead... many of the OS improvements are included.",05-03-2007 00:00,80.80.160.0/20,1173052800,0,0,FN,0.15

The V3xx has a 247mhz Arm9 process which the V3/V3i/V3r only have a 40mhz processor, V3x 70mhz,Krazr K1 only has a 66mhz processor. Also the V3xx has more built in memory than any other previous Razr phones with 60Mb expandable w/ upto 2GB SD. Another note the V3xx has the Nvidia Goforce 4800GPU which is great for the gamer. I had much faster framerates on my Java games. The Goforce 4800 also conserves battery life when you are not using the phone. I had the V3r razr and the batter drained much faster. The V3xx comes with the best screen so far with 240x320 Qvga screen. The old Qcif screens just do not look this good it is amazing. V3xx is a HDSPA 3G phone one of the only ones that cingular provides. It is much faster than the old GPRS/Edge/UMTS formats and allows for faster data downloads. Streaming video, and audio is also availble which is a great feature. The video camera is very good and supports full screen playback. Lastly the phone supports A2DP stereo bluetooth 2.0 support.Only drawbacks of the phone are the camera 1.3MP the Goforce chip supports upto 3MP and Motorola should of done that.

Well after the Palm got old and I wasnt using as much as I thought I would and with the extra weight of the Palm, I decided to buy a v3xx after reading all the reviews.I just cant say enough about this phone! Some of the great features I've noticed just in the few days since Ive had it:1. Great clarity and reception2. Just beautiful phone3. I can finally listen to songs via bluetooth! I couldnt even do this with my Treo! I always had to either listen through the phone itself or through a corded earpeice.4. Convienent options menu for the most popular menu options such as turning on bluetooth, music player, etc. No need to go scrolling through pages and pages of menus to get what you need.5. Lightning fast download speeds! Even with my Treo, it would take forever for a webpage to load. This Razr loads within seconds!I'm sure this phone has many other great features that I havent found yet, but these are the most impressive ones. I have yet to find a negative about this phone.

However I checked some websites and found out Amazon is mis-advertising and this is actually only a tri-band GSM 850/1800/1900.Although Motorola downgraded this aspect of the phone, you should still be able to use the phone in most countries (after having it unlocked) since services that run on GSM 900 also run on 1800 I think.Overall, having previously used a RAZR V3, I love this new V3xx.1) Camera is now 1.3 MP (compared to the V3's 0.3 MP), however, 2 MP would have been better.2) Screen is significantly sharper and the graphics are improved.3) Phonebook allows for multiple numbers per entry.4) External keys are now silent, so if you have previously used Motorola phones, you will find this a blessing; you no longer will be embarrassed when changing your ringer setting.Some more upgrades include:5) A cap for the mini-usb port to keep out the dust.6) When looking through your address book, you can now press multiple letters instead of just one--a definite time-saver and a given in Nokia phones.7) The '#' key now allows you to change your ringer setting to vibrate by holding it down for a second. Another hold will change your ringer back to the previous setting.8) The V3xx seems to save more battery by dimming and turning off both the external and internal screens much more quickly than the V3.9) For Sudoku lovers out there--yep, that game is on this phone. Although some features are disabled (such as Solver mode, Tutorial, or higher levels), there are no restrictions on playing 'Easy' level games.I would recommend this phone to everyone, especially previous RAZR and Motorola owners. The V3xx has a processor at least 4x faster than any previous Motorola phone. This means there is no longer a lag after pressing a button.",20-05-2007 00:00,82.114.64.0/20,1179619200,0,0,TN,0.15

In comparing the two phones, several things about the Razr prompted me to go back and exchange the Sync.The Razr keeps a subdued clock on the outside screen at all times; the Sync does not.The Razr is much easier to open with one hand.The Razr has voice-dial; the Sync does not.The Razr seems to have a cleaner sound for calls.The Razr is simply easier for me - an almost 40-something with no technical skills - to figure out. The screen icons are cleaner and the menus are more intuitive. I had the Sync for three days and still could not figure out half the stuff I wanted to. I've had the Razr for 3 hours and have already set it up the way I want it, including locking myself out of those expensive Media Net buttons. There's even a way to lock the AT&T; Music feature, but keep the ability to use the music player, which is in that menu, by making the music player one of the Navigation keys.Plus, the Razr is just prettier!The only thing I can think of that I don't like about the Razr is that the speaker does not sound very crisp at all. If you listen to music, I recommend headphones.Update June 2011 - I'm still using this phone, and it's still awesome. It never quits. My son has the same phone (he's now 17) and neither of us are easy on phones. It's simple, intuitive, light, and the battery life is still days long (we've never replaced the batteries.)

Sanchez ""book maven""",5,"Ok, Im goin to start by saying that over the past year, I had the SLVR L7 (Great MP3 phone) Sony Ericsson W600i (Best phone with stereo speakers) Samsung Blackjack (Ok Internet phone)Well I just got this phone yesterday and I had been using it for over 4 hours and I think from all of the phones, the Motorola V3xx is the best because I didnt have to buy any accesories for it since it uses the same accesories that the Slvr uses. When I first open the box and saw the phone shining, I was amaze because if you see in the pictures, the phone doesnt shine and if it does, its not as realistic as it should be.I put my blackjack's micro SD card and I turn on the phone and all my songs was recognize by the v3xx, Before i bought this phone I was wondering weather if you listen to the songs in the phone and close the lid of the phone if the music would stop but No it didn't. When you close the lid, in the litle display, it tells you the song and the artist and you dont need to open the phone to change songs. With the side buttons, you can change volume and songs.But the best thing that this phone offers is the BASS feature. Whenever you are listening to the songs, (go to options and select music options) there you an control the bass feature. It sounds good if you have the 3.5mm motorola adapter. (you can get it in amazon for 5.00$) I would say that this phone is way better than the krzr because this one have 3G and its fast. If you have a laptop, all you have to buy is the bluetooth adapter and use the phone as a modem, you DO NOT need the USB cable, although you could use it.Overall this is a great phone, Camera is good (WAY better than the razr V3). The reason why I return the blackjack was because the battery suck, and I realize that I didnt need a PDA phone. The speaker is pretty loud although if it was stereo it would it had a better sound but this phone doesn't need another speaker. This phone has everything you need on a phone. The internet browser is really good. I can even go to [...] and browse everything as I did with the blackjack.If you are a teenager or someone that needs a phone for calls and a lil more. Than I recommend this phone. This summer im goin to Puerto Rico and im goin to see if I can use it there. 3G is available in PR so im sure that I wont have any problems. If you have a ? just post it in here and I try to answer it.Hope is helpful. I'll be adding more updates as I use this phone.",24-05-2007 00:00,82.114.88.0/23,1179964800,0,0,TN,0.15
